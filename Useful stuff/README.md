- "Toggle Bluetooth" turns Bluetooth on and off with a notification.
- "Move app windows" moves the windows of a few apps when there's more than one display in use, since they can't remember how to do this themselves.
- "Touch selection" executes shell `touch` command on Finder selection.
- "PDF page numbers" puts page numbers onto existing pages of a PDF. Basic put handy. Assumes the presence of pdftk, pdfinfo, and pdflatex.
